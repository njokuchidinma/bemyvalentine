                    Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
                    Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>
                    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
                    And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.<br>
                    Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
                    And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br>
                    And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
                    By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;<br>
                    But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
                    Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,<br>
                    Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,<br>
                    When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.<br>
                    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br>
                    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
